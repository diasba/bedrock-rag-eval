What is Amazon Bedrock?,factual,"Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that provides secure, enterprise-grade access to high-performing foundation models from leading AI companies, enabling you to build and scale generative AI applications [Chunk 1].

Do you need model access permissions before using some Bedrock models?,factual,"Yes, for programmatic access to **third-party models** in Amazon Bedrock, you need to manage model access permissions using the SDK or CLI before invoking them [Chunk 1]. However, access to **Amazon Bedrock foundation models** is enabled by default with the correct AWS Marketplace permissions [Chunk 1]. Both `bedrock:InvokeModel` and `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream` actions require permissions for inference [Chunks 2, 3, 4].","Yes, you need to request and be granted model access before you can use foundation models in Amazon Bedrock.",0.5833,1.0,1.0,0.7793,0.6083

What is a Bedrock Knowledge Base used for?,factual,"A Bedrock Knowledge Base is used to integrate proprietary information into generative-AI applications by retrieving relevant data from connected data sources to improve the relevancy and accuracy of generated responses [Chunk 2]. It supports querying structured or unstructured data (including text, images, and multimodal documents) to enhance responses via RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflows [Chunk 1][Chunk 3].",A Bedrock Knowledge Base is used to give foundation models contextual information from your private data sources for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).,1.0,1.0,0.8,0.7873,0.6775
What does chunking do in a knowledge base pipeline?,factual,"Chunking splits each document in your data source into smaller subdivisions (chunks) based on token count and other parameters, which are then used to populate the `$search_results$` placeholder in the knowledge base prompt templates [Chunk 3]. This process helps shorten the content filled in the prompt templates, improving retrieval and generation efficiency [Chunk 1][Chunk 2].",Chunking splits documents into smaller segments so they can be efficiently embedded and retrieved during a query.,0.8333,0.0,0.75,0.8351,0.489
What is the purpose of RetrieveAndGenerate?,factual,"The `RetrieveAndGenerate` operation in AWS Bedrock combines the entire RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) process by:
1. Converting natural language queries into structured queries (if connected to a structured data store) using `GenerateQuery`,
2. Retrieving relevant chunks from the knowledge base, and
3. Generating a response from the LLM with citations to the original source data [Chunk 1][Chunk 2].","RetrieveAndGenerate queries a knowledge base, retrieves relevant results, and generates a response by augmenting the foundation model prompt with the retrieved information.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.6045,0.5922
"What is enabled by default with the correct AWS Marketplace permissions, and which table shows model support by AWS Region?",multi_hop,"Access to all Amazon Bedrock foundation models is enabled by default with the correct AWS Marketplace permissions [Chunk 1]. The table showing inference profile support by AWS Region is found in the ""Supported Regions and models for inference profiles"" section [Chunk 2].",Access to all Amazon Bedrock foundation models is enabled by default with the correct AWS Marketplace permissions. Model support by AWS Region is shown in the model support by AWS Region table.,0.0,0.5,1.0,0.4708,0.7667
"In fixed-size chunking, what two settings define chunk size and overlap, and in retrievalConfiguration.vectorSearchConfiguration which field sets the maximum number of results?",multi_hop,"In fixed-size chunking, the two settings are the **number of tokens per chunk** and the **overlap percentage** [Chunk 2]. In `retrievalConfiguration.vectorSearchConfiguration`, the **`numberOfResults`** field sets the maximum number of results [Chunk 1].","In fixed-size chunking, the two settings are the number of tokens per chunk and the overlap percentage. In retrievalConfiguration.vectorSearchConfiguration, the field that sets the maximum number of results is numberOfResults.",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.9013,0.8417
"In Amazon Bedrock, which feature searches your data to answer a query, and which feature evaluates both user inputs and model responses?",multi_hop,The feature that searches your data to answer a query is **Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases** [Chunk 1]. The feature that evaluates both retrieval effectiveness from data sources and the quality of generated responses is **Amazon Bedrock RAG evaluations** [Chunk 3].,"When a query is made, a knowledge base searches your data to find relevant information to answer the query. Amazon Bedrock Guardrails evaluates both user inputs and model responses.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.7831,0.3457
"For Amazon Bedrock inference, which endpoint is used for InvokeModel calls, and what controls model inference usage?",multi_hop,"For InvokeModel calls in Amazon Bedrock, use the region-specific endpoint: `bedrock-runtime.{region}.amazonaws.com` [Chunk 1].

Model inference usage is controlled via **service tiers** (to manage access) and **inference parameters** (to influence model behavior during inference) [Chunk 2][Chunk 3]. Guardrails can also be applied during inference calls [Chunk 4].",InvokeModel calls use the bedrock-runtime.{region}.amazonaws.com endpoint. Model inference in Amazon Bedrock is controlled by quotas on token usage.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.8336,0.6127
Can Bedrock KB do RAG-style retrieval before generation?,paraphrase,"Yes, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases supports RAG-style retrieval before generation using the `RetrieveAndGenerate` API, which performs the entire RAG process, or by decoupling the steps using the `Retrieve` operation followed by a custom generation step [Chunk 4]. This allows flexibility to customize retrieval and generation for specific use cases.","Yes, Bedrock Knowledge Bases support RAG-style retrieval before generation through the RetrieveAndGenerate API, which first queries the knowledge base for relevant results and then uses them to augment the prompt for the foundation model.",0.75,1.0,1.0,0.7292,0.7
How do I check token count before sending a prompt?,paraphrase,"Use the `CountTokens` operation, which accepts the same input formats as `InvokeModel` and `Converse`, to estimate token count before sending inference requests [Chunk 1].",You can use the CountTokens API operation to count the number of tokens in a prompt before sending it to a model.,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.6517,0.6714
Is there an API for streaming model responses?,paraphrase,"Yes, there are APIs for streaming model responses in Amazon Bedrock:

1. **ConverseStream** – Provides a consistent streaming API for models that support messages [Chunk 1].

3. **RetrieveAndGenerateStream** – Streams responses when querying a knowledge base [Chunk 2].","Yes, Amazon Bedrock supports response streaming through the InvokeModelWithResponseStream and ConverseStream API operations. The field 'responseStreamingSupported' in the API documentation indicates whether a specific model supports streaming.",0.75,1.0,1.0,0.7907,0.6565
Can I directly apply a guardrail through an API call?,paraphrase,"Yes, you can directly apply a guardrail through the **ApplyGuardrail API** without invoking a foundation model [Chunk 1][Chunk 4]. This API allows you to evaluate content against a guardrail by specifying the guardrail ID, version, and the content to be guarded [Chunk 2][Chunk 4].","Yes, you can apply a guardrail directly through the ApplyGuardrail API operation, which evaluates content against your configured guardrail policies.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.6638,0.7154

"In Amazon Bedrock inference, which service tier is used by default when the 'service_tier' parameter is missing?",factual,"The Standard tier is used by default when the ""service_tier"" parameter is missing [Chunk 1].","By default, inference requests are routed to the Standard tier when the 'service_tier' parameter is missing.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.7849,0.725
