What is a Bedrock Knowledge Base used for?,factual,"A Bedrock Knowledge Base is used to connect to a data source and retrieve data or information when queried, enabling retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows with large language models (LLMs) [Chunk 3, Chunk 4].

What does chunking do in a knowledge base pipeline?,factual,"Chunking in a knowledge base pipeline splits documents or content into smaller, manageable segments during ingestion. These chunks are converted into embeddings and stored in a vector index to enable efficient data retrieval, while maintaining a link to the original document [Chunk 4]. This process helps shorten the content filled in the `$search_results$` placeholder in prompt templates, improving retrieval and generation performance [Chunk 1][Chunk 2].",Chunking splits documents into smaller segments so they can be efficiently embedded and retrieved during a query.,0.25,1.0,0.875,0.9442,0.6572
What is the purpose of RetrieveAndGenerate?,factual,"The **RetrieveAndGenerate** operation combines the entire RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) process by:
1. Converting natural language queries into structured queries (if using a structured data store) via **GenerateQuery**,
2. Retrieving relevant chunks from the knowledge base via **Retrieve**, and
3. Generating a response using an LLM via **InvokeModel**, with citations to the original source data [Chunk 3][Chunk 4].","RetrieveAndGenerate queries a knowledge base, retrieves relevant results, and generates a response by augmenting the foundation model prompt with the retrieved information.",0.4167,1.0,1.0,0.6818,0.5847
"What is enabled by default with the correct AWS Marketplace permissions, and which table shows model support by AWS Region?",multi_hop,"Access to all Amazon Bedrock foundation models is enabled by default with the correct AWS Marketplace permissions [Chunk 1].

Model support by AWS Region is shown in the model support by AWS Region table.,0.0,0.5,1.0,0.4708,0.7667
"In fixed-size chunking, what two settings define chunk size and overlap, and in retrievalConfiguration.vectorSearchConfiguration which field sets the maximum number of results?",multi_hop,"In fixed-size chunking, the two settings are the **maximum number of tokens per chunk** and the **overlap percentage** between consecutive chunks [Chunk 4]. In `retrievalConfiguration.vectorSearchConfiguration`, the field that sets the maximum number of results is **`numberOfResults`** [Chunk 1].","In fixed-size chunking, the two settings are the number of tokens per chunk and the overlap percentage. In retrievalConfiguration.vectorSearchConfiguration, the field that sets the maximum number of results is numberOfResults.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.949,0.7698
"In Amazon Bedrock, which feature searches your data to answer a query, and which feature evaluates both user inputs and model responses?",multi_hop,The feature that searches your data to answer a query is **Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases** [Chunk 1]. The feature that evaluates both user inputs (prompts) and model responses is **Bedrock Guardrails** [Chunk 4].,"When a query is made, a knowledge base searches your data to find relevant information to answer the query. Amazon Bedrock Guardrails evaluates both user inputs and model responses.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.9068,0.7546
"For Amazon Bedrock inference, which endpoint is used for InvokeModel calls, and what controls model inference usage?",multi_hop,"For InvokeModel calls in Amazon Bedrock, use the **region-specific endpoints** in the format `bedrock-runtime.{region}.amazonaws.com` [Chunk 1].

Model inference usage is controlled through **Service Control Policies (SCP) or IAM policies**, which initially block access until you review and agree to the EULA terms [Chunk 3].",InvokeModel calls use the bedrock-runtime.{region}.amazonaws.com endpoint. Model inference in Amazon Bedrock is controlled by quotas on token usage.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.8622,0.6112
Can Bedrock KB do RAG-style retrieval before generation?,paraphrase,"Yes, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant information from data sources before generating responses [Chunk 2][Chunk 3][Chunk 4].","Yes, Bedrock Knowledge Bases support RAG-style retrieval before generation through the RetrieveAndGenerate API, which first queries the knowledge base for relevant results and then uses them to augment the prompt for the foundation model.",0.5833,0.0,1.0,0.6298,0.6099
How do I check token count before sending a prompt?,paraphrase,"Use the `CountTokens` API operation, which accepts the same input formats as `InvokeModel` or `Converse` and returns the token count that would be used for the given input [Chunk 1][Chunk 2].",You can use the CountTokens API operation to count the number of tokens in a prompt before sending it to a model.,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.5789,0.5685
Is there an API for streaming model responses?,paraphrase,"Yes, Amazon Bedrock provides streaming APIs for model responses, including **ConverseStream**, **InvokeModelWithResponseStream**, and **RetrieveAndGenerateStream** [Chunk 1][Chunk 3].
