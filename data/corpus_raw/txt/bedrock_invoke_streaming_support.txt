TITLE: Streaming support in Amazon Bedrock Runtime APIs
SOURCE: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_InvokeModel.html

Some Amazon Bedrock Runtime API operations support response streaming. In the API documentation, the field
"responseStreamingSupported" indicates whether a specific model supports response streaming.

Relevant operations for streaming include:
- ConverseStream
- InvokeModelWithResponseStream

If streaming is not supported by a model, you must use non-streaming operations such as Converse or InvokeModel.
